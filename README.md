# Information retrieval notes

Notes from Wroclaw University's Text Mining course with added Lucene examples.

**Lucene** is a Java library that underlies two huge Information Retrieval projects, Elasticsearch and Solr. 

These notes are aimed at bridging the gap between books like **Introduction to Information Retrieval** and resources on Lucene/Elasticsearch. 

They should be useful if you know something about IR, but want to learn Lucene, or you used Elasticsearch but wanted to know more about how it works.

## Requirements

The project is based on [jupyter-scala](https://github.com/jupyter-scala/jupyter-scala) notebooks.

## Useful resources

* [Introduction to Information Retrieval](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/)
* [Elasticsearch Reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html)
